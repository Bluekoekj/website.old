<h1>About</h1>
<p>This website was inspired by 2 things, my IT classes and <a href="holdup-1.html">lekr.site</a>, another website made in HTML and was then uploaded to GitHub pages. I used Adobe Dreamweaver CS6 from 2012 and HTML files to make my website look like this. I doubt this site will ever take off, but who knows, maybe it will!</p>
